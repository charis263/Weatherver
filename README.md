# Weatherver
README
**Approach taken**
This project is part of my SEI course under General Assembly.

This weather app is inspired by online weather checker app that provides real-time update of current weather. In order for real-time update of weather to be carried out, I obtained the API of current weather data from [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

**How it works**
Users are able to enter the website and key in their City and Country to check the current weather from the website.

**Tools/technologies**
There is no set requirement in this project other than to use the tools and knowledge learned during the course. Below are some of the tools and technologies adopted to build this project:

1) Type: Frontend using React library
2) Framework: Bootstrap
3) Language: JavaScript/XML
4) Interface: API

**Challenges and how I tackled them**
The main challenge that I faced initially was finding the right project idea to build given the time-frame and circumstances. With that I looked for Mr Google on different ideas and inspiration. The initial decision was to build an app inspired by Spotify due to my interest in music (but given my capacity, this will be something I will only be focusing on in future.)

****Throughout the duration of building the project, I reviewed through many documentation and found out various ways and tools to build the project and even many functions could be integrated as well. Thus this project will continue to be expanded and modified as time goes on to further build more functions/features.
